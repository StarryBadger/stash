# Description
### Welcome to stash
### Written in C, stash provides a versatile and efficient command-line interface for Unix-like systems
###### crafting simplicity from complexity

## Final branch
### To run the shell, run the command `make` on the terminal. This creates an executable `a.out` which can be run by `./a.out`

# Assumptions
## As stated/approved in the doubt document:
- `bash` has been used as the default hsell to determine outputs
- For peek and seek, green has been used for executables, white for files and blue for directories
- "Lexicographical ordering implies sorting a set of strings based on the ASCII values of the individual characters in a string". README.md appears before headers.h for peek
- For peek -l, the output is displayed exactly like bash, `%h %d %H:%M` for files not as old as 6 months, and `%h %d %Y` for files older than that. An average month length of 30.4 days has been considered to calculate this.
- <background_process_pid> is printed whenever one is executed as shown in Specification 6
- If background process is of a valid command with invalid operands, the pid will be printed and appropriate messages displayed. On entering the next prompt, the process will be displayed to have exited normally.
- pastevents are displayed in a specific format of `<command> ; <command> & command>` or if the last command is a background process, `<command> ; <command> & command> &`.
- For seek, when tthe arget is a file, all files with the filename of the form `file`, `file.extension` are displayed
- Commands followed by erronous commands separated by `;` or `&` are executed
- When a prompt takes >2 seconds to execute, the name of the first command is displayed (as we were allowed to display anything with proper assumptions and this felt the most aethetically pleasing)
- error messages generated by perror are not displayed in red.
- Assumptions have been made for path lengths to be PATH_MAX-1 as well as that only be 50 commands are in one prompt, each with a maximum of 128 paramters, each parameter with max 127 characters. Similarly, 16 commands can be piped together at maximum in a command, each of length 127.
- For activities, 'T' state processes are considered are Stopped, all other processes are considered Running
- A background process brought to foreground is rmoved from the background process list. No output is displayed on its termination.
- Stopped processes, on killing the terminal are finished after catching a deadly signal HUP
- iMan determines that the command is invalid if the man page has no instage of `NAME\n`, which is a common observation.
- Signals are implemented for system commands, which are implemented by fork().
- Block sizes may differ. `stBlocks` of struct `stat` has been used to determine sum of physical block sizes.
